        <h3>What Is GnL?</h3>
        <p>Every month E-renity project members gather together to discuss how to make
            improvements on different parts of our project. Usually our project members consist of activists,
            advocates, journalists, psychologists and highly efficient tech professionals, we are going to create
            seperate breakout rooms for each professional catagory, but we will gather in the end to summarise what
            we have discussed and submit a big amendment ) meeting for 1-2 hrs. If you cannot make to the meeting
            because of timezone differences- of course, we will choose the best time for everybody- you are required
            to write a 750-word proposal based on the work you've done during the month, and other members will
            discuss it as if you were present in the meeting. </p>
        <p>Victims used to be victim... </p>
        <p>But at the moment when they joined E-renity, the pain and terror in cyberstalking not only decreased and
            their life ameliorated, the support they got turns them into supporters of the people who supported them-
            the cybersecurity researchers, serious academia and deligent working professionals. </p>
        <p>Fortunes always come in turn. </p>
        <p>We create a human-powered cybersecurity company in the long term. </p>
